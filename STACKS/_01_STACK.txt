1. stack is data structure . 

2. We can implement the stack by using three methods : 
    a. ARRAYS b. ARRAYLISTS c. LINKEDLISTS 

3. If we use the arrays sometimes it is inefficient due to the fixed size of the array that's we use only the linkedlists and arraylists .

4. operations in stacks : 
 a. PUSH(O(1)) // it puts the element on the top of the stack
 b. POP(O(1))  // it remove or delete the element from the top of the stack
 c. PEEK(O(1)) // it get the top element in the stack

5. Stack is LIFO (LAST IN FIRST OUT DATA STRUCTURE) the element which go last in the stack or data structure comes out first from the data structure.
